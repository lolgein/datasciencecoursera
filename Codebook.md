#Codebook for Run_analysis

This codebook is been written for the script Run_analysis and will include all the variable names.

**Subject**: 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, each number stands for a different subject from 1-30.

**Activity**: Each person performed six activities.

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
For each record it is provided:

1. Mean of the Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
2. Mean of the Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
